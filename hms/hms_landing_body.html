    <h3>What is HMS?</h3>
    Hydrologic Micro Services, HMS, is a hydrologic and water quality modeling system comprised of data provisioning and modeling components and workflows to facilitate environmental modeling.
    The components are available as <a href="/hms/api_doc/">web services</a>, <a href="https://github.com/quanted/hms" target="_blank">desktop libraries</a>, and through a web-based graphical user interface.
    <br />
    <h3>How do I use HMS?</h3>
    HMS users can use the system components and workflows directly or build their own workflows outside the HMS web site by linking the components. Each component is available as a web service as well as a library for integration into workflows.
    HMS is an integrated modeling system to facilitate easier integration of new academic research on physical, chemical and biological processes into environmental models.
    <a href="/static_qed/hms/images/state_of_model_integration.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 1</a> depicts the ways HMS components and web services can be integrated into workflows.
    The target users for HMS are hydrological and water quality modelers and analysts.
    <br /><br />
    Additional information about HMS and how to use the components can be found on the <a href="/hms/help/">HMS documentation help page.</a>

<h2>Structure of HMS</h2>
<h3>Components</h3>
<p>An HMS component is a module that encapsulates a set of related functions and data representing a physical process in
    hydrology or fate and transport of a contaminant in water.  HMS components are presented as web services, software
    libraries, and web forms. Additional sub-components are available within these components; such as Curve Number within
    Surface Runoff and Baseflow, and Constant Volume Routing within Streamflow.
</p>
<h4>Work Flows</h4>
<p>An HMS workflow is an orchestrated pattern of executing components to simulate movement and storage of water and the consequential effects on fate and transport of contaminants in water. The following workflows are currently available in HMS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Precipitation Data Extraction</li>
    <li>Precipitation Comparison</li>
    <li>Streamflow</li>
</ul>
<h4>Meteorology</h4>
<p>Meteorological components in HMS represent major physical processes that are utilized as forcing data for hydrologic modeling. The following meteorology component(s) are currently available in HMS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Humidity</li>
    <li>Precipitation</li>
    <li>Radiation</li>
    <li>Temperature</li>
    <li>Wind</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hydrology</h4>
<p>Hydrological components in HMS represent major physical processes affecting water quantity, storage, and flow. The following hydrology component(s) are currently available in HMS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Evapotranspiration</li>
    <li>Surface Runoff</li>
    <li>Soil Moisture</li>
    <li>Subsurface Flow</li>
</ul>
