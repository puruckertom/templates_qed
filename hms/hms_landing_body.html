<p>
    Hydrologic Micro Services, HMS, is a watershed modeling system comprised of data provisioning and modeling components and workflows to facilitate environmental modeling.
    The components are available as <a href="/hms/api_doc/">web services</a>, <a href="https://github.com/quanted/hms" target="_blank">desktop libraries</a>, and through a <a href="/hms/">web-based graphical user interface</a>.
    The target users for HMS are hydrological and water quality modelers and analysts.
    HHMS users can use the system components and workflows directly or build their own workflows outside the HMS web site by linking the components.  Each component is available as a web service as well as a library for integration into workflows.
    <br /><br />
    All HMS component and workflow web pages have a consistent presentation structure consisting of five tabs: ‘Overview’, ‘Data Request’, ‘Output Data’, ‘Retrieve Data’, and ‘Data Algorithms’.  The ‘Overview’ tab has five collapsible panels: ‘Description’
    panel with a brief description of the component/workflow, ‘Input Parameters’ panel with details of the input parameters on the ‘Data Request’ tab, ‘Output Parameters’ with  a brief description of output objects produced by the component/workflow ,
    ‘Web Service Details’ panel with link to Swagger documentation, and ‘Code Samples’ panel with links to web services sample client codes.  ‘Data Request’ tab has the web form where the user can enter values of input parameters and run the component/workflow.
    When the user submits a request on the ‘Data Request’ tab, ‘Output Data’ tab gets automatically activated and shows a Task ID generated by HMS.  The user has the option of waiting on the ‘Output Data’ tab until the task finishes and the outputs are shown.
    The other option for the user is to copy the Task ID and leave the page and come back later and click on the ‘Retrieve Data’ tab where outputs can be retrieved by entering the Task ID.  ‘Data Algorithms’ tab provides details about the algorithms and sources
    of data related to the component/workflow.

<h2>Structure of HMS</h2>
<h3>Components</h3>
<p>An HMS component is a module that encapsulates a set of related functions and data representing a physical process in
    hydrology or fate and transport of a contaminant in water.  HMS components are presented as web services, software
    libraries, and web forms. Additional sub-components are available within these components; such as Curve Number within
    Surface Runoff and Baseflow, and Constant Volume Routing within Streamflow.
</p>
<h4>Work Flows</h4>
<p>An HMS workflow is an orchestrated pattern of executing components to simulate movement and storage of water and the consequential effects on fate and transport of contaminants in water. The following workflows are currently available in HMS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Precipitation Data Extraction</li>
    <li>Precipitation Comparison</li>
    <li>Streamflow</li>
</ul>
<h4>Meteorology</h4>
<p>An HMS workflow is an orchestrated pattern of executing components to simulate movement and storage of water and the consequential effects on fate and transport of contaminants in water. The following meteorology component(s) are currently available in HMS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Humidity</li>
    <li>Precipitation</li>
    <li>Radiation</li>
    <li>Solar Calculator</li>
    <li>Temperature</li>
    <li>Wind</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hydrology</h4>
<p>Hydrological components in HMS represent major physical processes affecting water quantity, storage, and flow. The following hydrology component(s) are currently available in HMS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Evapotranspiration</li>
    <li>Surface Runoff</li>
    <li>Soil Moisture</li>
    <li>Subsurface Flow</li>
</ul>
