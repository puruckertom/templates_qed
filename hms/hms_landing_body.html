<p>
    Hydrologic Micro Services, HMS, is a watershed modeling system comprised of data provisioning and modeling components and workflows to facilitate environmental modeling.
    The components are available as <a href="/hms/api_doc/">web services</a>, <a href="https://github.com/quanted/hms" target="_blank">desktop libraries</a>, and through a <a href="/hms/">web-based graphical user interface</a>.
    The target users for HMS are hydrological and water quality modelers and analysts.
    HMS users can use the system components and workflows directly or build their own workflows by linking the components.
</p>

<p><i>HMS functionality will be limited when using the Internet Explorer web browser. We recommend using the latest version of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Mozilla Firefox.</i></p>

<h2>Structure of HMS web app</h2>
<h3>Components</h3>
<p>An HMS component is a module that encapsulates a set of related functions and data representing a physical process in
    hydrology or fate and transport of a contaminant in water.  HMS components are presented as web services, software
    libraries, and web forms. Additional sub-components are available within these components; such as Curve Number within
    Surface Runoff and Baseflow, and Constant Volume Routing within Streamflow.
</p>
<h4>Work Flows</h4>
<p>An HMS workflow is an orchestrated pattern of executing components to simulate movement and storage of water and the consequential effects on fate and transport of contaminants in water. The following workflows are currently available in HMS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Precipitation Data Extraction</li>
    <li>Precipitation Comparison</li>
</ul>
<h4>Meteorology</h4>
<p>An HMS workflow is an orchestrated pattern of executing components to simulate movement and storage of water and the consequential effects on fate and transport of contaminants in water. The following meteorology component(s) are currently available in HMS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Humidity</li>
    <li>Precipitation</li>
    <li>Radiation</li>
    <li>Solar Calculator</li>
    <li>Temperature</li>
    <li>Wind</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hydrology</h4>
<p>Hydrological components in HMS represent major physical processes affecting water quantity, storage, and flow. The following hydrology component(s) are currently available in HMS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Streamflow</li>
    <li>Evapotranspiration</li>
    <li>Surface Runoff</li>
    <li>Soil Moisture</li>
    <li>Subsurface Flow</li>
</ul>
