The Chemical Transformation Simulator (CTS) is an online tool that calculates the physico-chemical properties of a parent chemical and its transformation products. CTS predicts transformation products as a function of the environmental system of interest.
<br><br>
CTS performs these calculations and predictions by integrating:
<ul class="bullet_indent">
<li>Cheminformatics applications that encodes our knowledge (i.e., the process science) underlying transformation pathways; </li>
<li>Computational chemistry tools that calculate physico-chemical properties; and</li>
<li>Software that allows access to online databases of measured physico-chemical properties.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>CTS Workflows</h3>

<p>Choose one of the three workflows below to start using CTS.  Full descriptions of the individual workflows and modules are provided by the tabs in the left-hand navigation.</p>

<p><b>Calculate Chemical Speciation Workflow:</b>  Uses CTS’s Chemical Editor (CE) Module, which provides options for chemical entry and calculates the speciation (i.e., ionization, tautomer distribution and isomerization) of the parent chemical.</p>

<p><b>Calculate Physicochemical Properties Workflow:</b>  Uses CTS’s Chemical Editor (CE) and Reaction Pathway Simulator (RPS) Modules.  These modules work together to determine transformation products by executing certain reaction libraries, based on user-specified conditions.  The user is then given the option to use the PCP Module to calculate p-chem properties for one or more parent or product chemicals.</p>

<p><b>Generate Transformation Products Workflow:</b>  The User inputs chemical information through the CE and then invokes the Reaction Pathway Simulator (RPS) Module to generate transformation products through the execution of reaction libraries based on user-specified conditions. The User is then given the option to invoke the PCP Module for the calculation of physicochemical properties for one or more parent or product chemicals.</p>
