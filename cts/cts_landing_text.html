The Chemical Transformation Simulator (CTS) is an online tool that calculates the physicochemical properties of a parent chemical and its transformation products. CTS predicts transformation products as a function of the environmental system of interest.
<br><br>
CTS performs these calculations and predictions by integrating:
<ul class="bullet_indent">
<li>Cheminformatics applications that encodes our knowledge (i.e., the process science) underlying transformation pathways; </li>
<li>Computational chemistry tools that calculate physicochemical properties; and</li>
<li>Software that allows access to online databases of measured physicochemical properties.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>
<h3>CTS Workflows</h3>

<p>Execution of the CTS is initiated by selecting one of three available workflows. Full descriptions of the individual workflows and modules are provided by clicking on the tabs in the navigation panel.</p>

<p><b>Calculate Chemical Speciation Workflow:</b>  Uses CTS’s Chemical Editor (CE) Module, which provides options for chemical entry and calculates the speciation (i.e., ionization, tautomer distribution and isomerization) of the parent chemical.</p>

<p><b>Calculate Physicochemical Properties Workflow:</b>  Uses CTS’s Chemical Editor (CE) and the Physicochemical Properties Calculator (PCP) Module. The PCP Module uses four stand-alone calculators (EPI Suite, SPARC, ChemAxon, and TEST) to find physicochemical properties for the entered chemical.</p>

<p><b>Generate Transformation Products Workflow:</b>  The User inputs chemical information through the CE and then invokes the Reaction Pathway Simulator (RPS) Module to generate transformation products through the execution of reaction libraries based on user-specified conditions. The User is then given the option to invoke the PCP Module for the calculation of physicochemical properties for one or more parent or product chemicals.</p>
