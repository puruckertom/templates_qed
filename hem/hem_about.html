            <p>The Human Exposure Model (HEM) is being developed to assess near-field exposures to chemicals that occur
                in various populations over the life cycle of a consumer product. The model produces estimates of population
                distributions of chemical exposure by route, and releases to the environment, for over 300 categories of
                consumer products over one year. To see aggregate exposure to a chemical from the use of all consumer
                product categories within the scope of HEM, select 'Chemicals.' To see exposure to all chemicals in a
                particular product category, from the use of that product category, select 'Products.'
