    <p>Communities sit at the intersection where the natural, built and social environments meet. From creating jobs to
        building greener infrastructure, many considerations are needed to yield the most sustainable decision outcomes
        for a community. Understanding what aspects about your community you value and wish to sustain or improve may
        help inform community planning decisions.</p>
    <p>Indicators and indices can be used to assess various attributes about your community. Indicators summarize raw
        measures (e.g., median income, disease prevalence) to help interpret data patterns and trends. For communities,
        no single index or indicator set can offer a complete picture of status or conditions. However, an integrative
        approach that synthesizes information from many different indicator sets can offer broader insight from multiple
        viewpoints.</p>
    <p>The Decision Integration for Strong Communities (DISC) application is a simple and intuitive tool designed to
        bring together information from many indicator products to help characterize quality of life in your community
        and present resources that may present ways to help improve aspects about your community that you value.</p>

                                provides a profile about select community characteristics. The index is based on

                                related data. The DISC profile index provides a snapshot about quality of life

                                    Humans' connection with nature is a subjective trait most easily explained by the
                                    biophilia hypothesis. Biophilia is a term coined by prominent evolutionary biologist
                                    and entomologist, Edward O. Wilson, who defined it as the "innately emotional
                                    affiliation of human beings to other living organisms" and hypothesized that this
                                    psychological, and possibly genetic, phenomena arose due to humans' long time
                                    interaction with the natural environment. Biophilia is most evident by the
                                    popularity of zoos and outdoor activities and in people who have non-economic
                                    motivations for the protection of natural areas and biodiversity, such as positive
                                    experiences of an area, solastalgia, and having affection or sympathy for non- human
                                    species.

                                    Biophilia is also evident in other domains of well-being such as spiritual and
                                    cultural fulfillment, education, health, and leisure time. Humans, however, are
                                    experiencing an increasing disconnection with nature through urban development and
                                    technology— especially noted in children as the "nature-deficit disorder" and
                                    coincides with rising trends in obesity, attention deficit disorder, and depression.
                                    An attempt to correct this growing disconnection and to incorporate the health of
                                    the environment in land use planning is through "biophilic design", which aims to
                                    enhance human physical health, psychological benefits, and productivity by fostering
                                    a human-nature connection. Although our detachment with nature will never completely
                                    rid us of the desire to associate with nature, it can weaken our appreciation for
                                    nature and decrease our well-being.

                                    Economic and social services have significant direct and indirect effects on the
                                    connection to nature domain. For example, economic programs and funding can increase
                                    or decrease natural areas, either by putting aside more areas or decreasing those
                                    areas through capital investment. Additionally, social services such as activism,
                                    community and faith-based initiatives, justice (e.g., environmental justice), and
                                    public works can affect policies that support ecosystems or can possibly be used as
                                    indirect measures of our connection to nature.

                                    While there are many variations of the specific definition, few would argue the
                                    important role of spirituality and culture within populations. Cultural values are
                                    in many ways integral to vital communities, yet are rarely considered in most
                                    well-being indices. Investment in museums, cultural centers, and other similar
                                    gathering places offer educational opportunities to help mitigate inequities typical
                                    of cultural exclusion. Faith- and community-based activities, such as festivals,
                                    concerts, arts and crafts shows, etc., further strengthen social cohesion by
                                    preserving cultural and spiritual heritage. Moreover, it is the environmental
                                    culture that is often the harmonizing factor that supports community vitality when
                                    obvious economic disparity would otherwise cause discord.

                                    The domain of education is defined as the outcomes derived from the formal and
                                    informal transfer of knowledge and skills and is measured using standardized test
                                    scores, literacy rates, educational attainment and participation, and various
                                    social, emotional, and developmental aspects in childhood. Education has been
                                    referred to as a basic capability leading to the expansion of other capabilities and
                                    is fundamental to well-being. Educational progress and benefits influence other
                                    well-being domains and may be measured at the individual level by economic returns
                                    by subjective feelings of achievement and accomplishment, or at a societal level by
                                    creating a skilled workforce with enhanced worker productivity, lower crime rates,
                                    and greater civic participation.

                                    Economic and social services provide funding and other programs that influence the
                                    access to and opportunities for education. Educational services provide programs are
                                    aimed at reaching more students, especially those with disabilities or other special
                                    circumstances, and hiring qualified teachers. Community and faith-based initiatives
                                    may also act in this manner to reach additional children and families. Communication
                                    through public broadcasting and public service announcements helps educate the
                                    public about various issues (e.g., public health issues). Financial assistance in
                                    the form of grants, scholarships, and student loans is also essential to allow
                                    opportunities for post-secondary education.

                                    conditions. This domain also incorporates lifestyle behavior and healthcare, all of
                                    which influences a population's health status. Food utilization (a part of food
                                    security) also falls into this domain because of its connection to healthy
                                    behaviors. Other outside influences such as environmental quality (e.g., clean air
                                    days, clean water, etc.) are captured through indicators of ecosystem services.

                                    The connections between economic services and human health are so numerous and
                                    complex that an entire sub-discipline of economics, known as health economics, has
                                    emerged. Economic assessments of health- related interventions are critical to
                                    decision makers because expenditure on health care in the United States has outpaced
                                    the general rate of inflation. Social services are also strongly tied to human
                                    health. Many large organizations within the U.S. government were formed to protect
                                    and enhance the health of the U.S. population, and several well-known private
                                    organizations, such as the American Red Cross, United Way of America, and Ronald
                                    McDonald House Charities, provide health-related services to populations in need.

                                    Leisure time is time that individuals have to voluntarily engage in pleasurable
                                    activities when they are free from the demands of work or other responsibilities. It
                                    is commonly deemed as necessary for basic survival and has increasingly been
                                    referred to as a domain of the "good life". Suggested metrics of this domain are the
                                    amount of time spent on specific leisure activities, types of activities, frequency
                                    of participation, and expenditures on leisure activities. Measures of work hours and
                                    continuous sleep time can be used as surrogate measures indicating the amount of
                                    time available for leisure activities. Enjoyable activities may also act as
                                    "restorers" that facilitate the individual's recovery from stress as the result of
                                    positive social interactions or relaxation that lead to increased positive emotions.

                                    Participation in leisure time activities has been positively linked to both physical
                                    and mental health measures. Leisure time also provides for psychological detachment
                                    from work which in turn promotes well-being and productivity. Leisure time
                                    activities also provide opportunities for social interactions through group
                                    participation (e.g., clubs, sports, religious organizations) and expand the size of
                                    social networks, enhancing social cohesion. Higher income has been positively
                                    associated with increased leisure time as it relates to more disposable income;
                                    however, in the U.S. the cost of the loss of leisure time due to increased work
                                    hours has continued to rise since the 1950s.

                                    In the simplest of terms, living standards may be best described as "the physical
                                    circumstances in which people live, the goods and services they are able to consume
                                    and the economic resources to which they have access". Living standard indicators
                                    tend to be largely economic in nature, characterized by demography and geography.
                                    Income level is the most dominate class of metrics used for evaluating standard of
                                    living followed by living conditions which includes housing status, household
                                    crowding (rooms per person), and state of housing repair. Home ownership, household
                                    assets, and other measures of material affluence were used to evaluate wealth.

                                    Economic and social services aim to improve the living standards of a population.
                                    Economic services provide a means to accumulate and distribute wealth, while many
                                    social services help to improve living conditions among the most impoverished within
                                    the community.
                                    Poverty metrics (e.g., income- and housing-related) figure promi- nently in living
                                    standard assessments because there is a close relationship between standards of
                                    living and attainment of basic human needs. However, wealth disparity alone cannot
                                    fully account for standards of living. Current research suggests that
                                    conceptualizing basic human needs in light of multi-dimensional well- being may
                                    provide a more comprehensive picture relative to living standards. For example,
                                    indices that exclude time use measures may be missing non-market activities that may

                                    Further, the perception of living standards is often an overlooked influence on a
                                    population's overall well-being.

                                    Based on Maslow's hierarchy of basic human needs, once physical needs are relatively
                                    satisfied, safety needs take precedence. Personal security can be linked to
                                    unemployment, poverty, education level and social cohesion, and is most often
                                    evaluated using crime rates, number of accident-related injuries and deaths, and
                                    perceived safety. In basic terms, safety and security can be described as freedom
                                    from harm (physical security—personal and national) but is also described by
                                    measures related to financial security. Economic security is evaluated in the event
                                    of unemployment, sickness, widowhood, old age and disability. These measures can be
                                    linked to economic services of employment and income and heavily associated with
                                    social nets provided through the provisioning of social services — particularly
                                    financial assistance and healthcare. Our sense of safety and security can be altered
                                    in the wake of technological and natural disasters due to degradation of ecosystems,
                                    economic loss, and increased reliance on social safety nets and recovery services.
                                    From the ecosystem services perspective, clean water and air, sufficient food
                                    production, and natural hazard protection significantly contribute to our sense of
                                    safety and security through direct relationships to our health via exposure to
                                    pathogens and contaminants, food supply, and prevention of loss of life and
                                    property. Additionally, there is a comfort derived from knowing that we are not on
                                    the brink of environmental problems and that a natural system will be conserved for
                                    future generations.

                                    The ties that bind humans together in society have a large bearing on our personal
                                    well-being and the well- being of our community. A social network propagates
                                    opportunities to enhance the quality of life to all of its members, and creates a
                                    safety net for difficult times. A cohesive community allows open discussion and
                                    resolution of difficult problems, and gives its members a sense of identity.

                                    Social participation of all concerned citizens is essential to obtaining
                                    environmental well-being. Indicators of social cohesion vary greatly, with the most
                                    common indicator being volunteering rates.
                                    <br>
                                    Measures of the health of one's social network typically revolved around qualitative
                                    assessments of existing relationships and quantitative assessments of the size of
                                    the network. Feelings and behaviors associated with trust and reciprocity are often
                                    used as a proxy for community cohesion. Divorce rates, migration patterns, family
                                    demographics, and charitable contributions were some of the more objective measures
                                    used to measure cohesiveness.
                                </p>

                                    Social services can establish social norms that promote cohesion, repair and
                                    strengthen family cohesion, and provide safe, equitable working environments which
                                    foster healthy coworker relationship development.
                                    Economic services impact social cohesion by creating equitable wages and
                                    redistributing wealth, thereby relieving tensions between different social-economic
                                    classes, and they allow businesses to generate excess revenue to be given back to
                                    the community.

        <p>The DISC profile and related characteristic scores may be used to understand aspects that are potentially
            influencing your community's DISC profile and to see how these characteristics may differ in other
            communities. These comparisons may help identify possible improvement opportunities to explore as well as
            provide context for interpreting DISC scores.</p>
