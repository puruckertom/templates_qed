<p>Twenty-two economic, ecosystem, and social services values (Table 1) are used to estimate scores for eight "domains of well-being" (Table 2).
Multiple linear regression and relationship-function statistical techniques were used to identify correlations and calculate
coefficient values for each service-domain relationship.
