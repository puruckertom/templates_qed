The Cyanobacteria Assessment Network (CyAN) is a multi-agency project among the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and EPA to develop an early warning indicator
 system using historical and current satellite data to detect algal blooms in U.S. freshwater systems. This research supports federal,
 state, and local partners in their monitoring efforts to assess water quality to protect aquatic and human health.
