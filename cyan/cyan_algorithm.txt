<p>The USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center has completed the initial phase of development for a Landsat surface temperature product. The algorithm development was a collaborative effort between the Rochester Institute of Technology and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Provisional surface temperature products were provided for evaluation and validation. The results from these analyses will inform the CyAN project on how surface temperature data may be routinely used for assessing the onset of harmful algal blooms when combined with other land cover and land use information. In addition Landsat-8 atmospheric correction, chlorophyll-a algorithm calibration and initial validation were completed using a small subset of lakes.
NOAA has assembled water quality data covering most lakes in central Florida from St Johns River Water Management District and the LakeWatch program.  Additional data for Lake Okeechobee has been collected in order to evaluate for blooms, particularly in context of the major blooms of 2016. Methods have been configured for processing to final CI products, including flagging for faulty data in a way that allows rapid reprocessing.</p>
